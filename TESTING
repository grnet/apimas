Testing apimas
==============

Due to breaking changes introduced during apimas refactoring that takes place 
in `feature-new-construction` branch, most of the existing apimas/apimas-django 
tests no longer work. Until the apimas development process and API gets 
stabilized and for developers to still be able to partially test their changes 
an initial set of tests exist within the apimas-django example app. 

Tests make use of `pytest` library and a custom client fixture is provided 
from the `apimas_django.test` module.

Running the tests
=================

    
    $ pip install -r apimas-django/requirements_dev.txt
    $ pytest apimas-django
    

`pytest` along with installed plugins, comes with a bunch of helpful arguments,
a nice set for TDD is::

    $ pytest --nomigrations --pdb -s --disable-warnings --tb=no --maxfail=1 apimas-django
